# `mutation_overlaps_enhancer` support-gated canonical promotion

Kanban task: `t_00551bc3`  
Source staged candidate: `t_73c67c1b`  
Reviewer for staged candidate: `t_2fb6ffeb`  
Status: `canonical promoted` / `review-required`

## Bottom line

The reviewed full support-gated `mutation_overlaps_enhancer` candidate from `t_73c67c1b` was promoted to canonical KG paths after strict dry-run gates passed. This does **not** promote raw coordinate overlap alone: every promoted row is the reviewed non-context-support-gated candidate and has evidence JSON recording the non-protein-change external support gate.

## Gates run

Dry-run promotion manifest passed with no blockers:

- manifest cleanliness: actual files = 8, listed files = 8, no missing/extra files;
- staged edge/evidence rows = 1,664,278 / 1,664,278;
- unique endpoints = 5,814 mutations and 114,191 enhancers;
- duplicate edge keys = 0;
- duplicate evidence keys = 0;
- edges without evidence = 0;
- evidence without edge = 0;
- live endpoint anti-joins against canonical `nodes/mutation.parquet` and `nodes/enhancer.parquet` = 0 missing mutation endpoints and 0 missing enhancer endpoints;
- all output mutations have non-context support summary rows;
- output edges not in reviewed raw overlap source = 0;
- rows supported only by protein/context evidence in output = 0;
- evidence `text_span` JSON carries `support_gate.passed_non_context_support=true` and non-context support row count > 0.

Post-write validation:

- canonical edge/evidence/support files are byte/hash-identical to the dry-run-validated staged sources;
- official targeted `manage_db.audit_edge_evidence` passed for `mutation_overlaps_enhancer` with `ok=true`, `edges_without_evidence=0`, `evidence_without_edge=0`;
- promotion report was written to local `artifacts/reports/` and canonical `metadata/`.

## Support policy preserved

This promotion is for the reviewed support-gated candidate only. Raw coordinate overlap alone remains context/support-only and is not proof of enhancer perturbation. Evidence rows use predicate `coordinate_overlap_with_non_context_external_variant_support_gate` and preserve a leakage policy in `text_span`.

Non-context support classes in the reviewed source:

| Support class | Support rows |
| --- | ---: |
| ClinVar/EVA disease support | 7,612 |
| GWAS credible-set disease support | 844 |
| GWAS/L2G gene support | 623 |
| ClinVar/EVA phenotype support | 70 |
| UniProt variant disease support | 50 |
| ClinVar/EVA somatic disease support | 2 |

## Residual risks

- The relation remains associative/indirect (`direct=False` in schema): most available support is disease/gene/phenotype association context rather than direct enhancer-activity perturbation.
- Stronger eQTL, caQTL, MPRA, or allele-specific regulatory evidence was not available in the current KG support inputs and should remain preferred for future refinement.
- The canonical write is intentionally `review-required`; downstream training/export should respect the leakage warning in the evidence metadata.

## Rollback notes

If reviewer/tester rejects this promotion, remove the exact canonical edge/evidence paths and task-specific metadata sidecars listed above, then revert status docs from `canonical promoted / review-required` to the prior validated staged-only state.
