# disease_manifests_in_tissue canonical promotion — t_5fe137a0

Date: 2026-06-24  
Producer/staged source: `t_badd3e1e`, semantic approval from `t_7e5953c2`.  
Status at promotion: `canonical promoted` / `review-required`.

> **Supersession note (2026-07-22):** consolidated independent reviewer `t_2d1f767d` passed this exact immutable, narrowly scoped HPA/TCGA canonical revision. Current status is `canonical promoted` / independently accepted; the narrow cancer-context semantics remain unchanged.

## Scope

Promoted only the bounded Human Protein Atlas Pathology Atlas / TCGA cancer-prognostics `disease_manifests_in_tissue` candidate from:

```text
artifacts/staged/t_badd3e1e/disease-tissue-phenotype-context/
```

to canonical KG root `gs://jouvencekb/kg/v2` / `/Users/jkobject/mnt/gcs/jouvencekb-kg/v2`.

No broader `t_badd3e1e` relation-gap batch was promoted. No `phenotype_observed_in_tissue`, `disease_comorbid_disease`, `cell_type_*`, or rejected HPA candidate rows were promoted.

## Validated counts and semantics

Post-write validation report: `artifacts/reports/t_5fe137a0_postwrite_validation.json`.

- edge rows: 19
- evidence rows: 29
- distinct evidence-supported edge keys: 19
- duplicate `relation|x_id|y_id` edge keys: 0
- disease endpoint anti-joins: 0
- tissue endpoint anti-joins: 0
- edge/evidence support gaps: 0 / 0
- source audit rows re-read: 25
- rejected candidate rows re-read: 2
- staged/canonical sha256 mismatches: 0

Evidence preserves the bounded source semantics:

- `source`: `Human Protein Atlas`
- `source_dataset`: `proteinatlas.tsv Cancer prognostics columns`
- predicate: `Cancer prognostics column denotes TCGA/validation cancer type context`
- release: `HPA 25.1`
- license: `HPA downloadable data; see https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download`
- non-empty `source_record_id`
- `text_span` JSON with HPA cancer type/column, disease+tissue mapping confidences, and non-empty/prognostic gene-row counts.

The rejected HPA labels remain excluded from canonical edge/evidence rows:

- `Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma`
- `Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma`

Observed outputs:

- staged preflight validation: `ok: true`, 19 edges / 29 evidence, 0 endpoint anti-joins, 0 duplicate edges, 0 support gaps.
- staged `manage_db.audit_edge_evidence`: `ok: true`, 19 edges / 29 evidence, 0 edges without evidence, 0 evidence without edge.
- `tests/test_build_staged_disease_tissue_context.py`: 3 passed in 0.19s.
- canonical post-write validation: `ok: true`, staged/canonical sha256 matched for both files.
- canonical `manage_db.audit_edge_evidence`: `ok: true`, 19 edges / 29 evidence, 0 edges without evidence, 0 evidence without edge.

## Residual risks / review notes

Independent review is still required before this promotion is treated as accepted. This is a narrow cancer-context-specific HPA/TCGA promotion, not a broad all-disease pathology tissue-manifestation graph.
