# TxGNN / Jouvence KG Schema Overview

This document is the readable schema/status overview for the current Jouvence KG. It was refreshed by Kanban task `t_0b1f53d9` from `manage_db/kg_schema.py`, `manage_db/kg_evidence.py`, and canonical FUSE root `/Users/jkobject/mnt/gcs/jouvencekb-kg/v2`.

For the full per-relation next-action table, see `docs/relation_coverage_current.md`.

## Current canonical snapshot

- Canonical KG root audited: `/Users/jkobject/mnt/gcs/jouvencekb-kg/v2`
- Node files: `15 / 15`
- Node rows: `55,523,691`
- Declared active relations: `67`
- Canonical edge files: `40 / 67`
- Canonical edge rows: `100,080,390`
- Evidence files: `18`
- Canonical relations with evidence file: `18`
- Declared relations not canonical yet: `27`

Dataset/paper policy note (`t_c07b8b57`, cleanup `t_d97c4547`): existing
`dataset`/`paper` node files and `dataset_contains_*` metadata edge files are
retained in place as metadata-only/non-training inventory after reviewer-accepted
backup gate `t_9ad833bf`. They are disconnected from default
training/inference graph exports; the canonical policy sidecar is
`metadata/dataset_paper_graph_policy_t_d97c4547.{json,md}`.

## Node Schema & GCS Coverage

| Node type | Rows | Present? |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `paper` | 2,958,199 | yes |
| `gene` | 267,830 | yes |
| `transcript` | 507,365 | yes |
| `protein` | 233,995 | yes |
| `pathway` | 48,575 | yes |
| `molecule` | 31,007 | yes |
| `mutation` | 2,589,509 | yes |
| `disease` | 41,859 | yes |
| `cell_type` | 3,513 | yes |
| `tissue` | 16,061 | yes |
| `phenotype` | 16,449 | yes |
| `cell_line` | 1,183 | yes |
| `organism` | 1 | yes |
| `dataset` | 1 | yes |
| `enhancer` | 48,808,144 | yes |

Planned source-native node families remain non-active until schema extension: `protein_complex`, structured PTM/site/event nodes, and mature/precursor miRNA nodes where the entity is distinct from an existing ENST transcript node.

## Relation status summary

| Bucket | Count | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `canonical+validated` | 37 | Derived from RELATIONS plus current FUSE/bucket inventory. |
| `canonical promoted / review-accepted` | 1 | `mutation_affects_transcript` was promoted by `t_225ae18c` from the accepted all-part OpenTargets 26.03 candidate and accepted by independent review. |
| `canonical promoted / review-required` | 3 | `mutation_in_gene` was promoted by `t_1cfcd48f`; `mutation_overlaps_enhancer` was promoted by `t_00551bc3` from the reviewed non-context-support-gated `t_73c67c1b` candidate; `disease_manifests_in_tissue` was narrowly promoted by `t_5fe137a0` from the approved HPA/TCGA bounded candidate. Independent review is still required for all three. |
| `canonical with evidence file` | 18 | Derived from RELATIONS plus current FUSE/bucket inventory. |
| `canonical without evidence file` | 22 | Derived from RELATIONS plus current FUSE/bucket inventory. |
| `staged-only/deferred` | 18 | Derived from RELATIONS plus current FUSE/bucket inventory. |
| `source-audit-only/deferred` | 2 | Derived from RELATIONS plus current FUSE/bucket inventory. |
| `feature-context-not-edge` | 2 | Derived from RELATIONS plus current FUSE/bucket inventory. |
| `schema-only/missing` | 5 | Derived from RELATIONS plus current FUSE/bucket inventory. |
| `intentionally retired active relations` | 0 | None in active RELATIONS; stale/non-active concepts are listed below. |

## Edge schema

All canonical edge Parquet files use at minimum:

```text
x_id, x_type, y_id, y_type, relation, display_relation,
source, credibility, [additional metadata columns...]
```

Evidence/support records live in `evidence/{relation}.parquet`, keyed by relation and edge endpoints, with source-specific fields such as `evidence_type`, `source`, `source_dataset`, `source_record_id`, `paper_id`, `dataset_id`, `study_id`, `evidence_score`, effect/statistical fields, predicate/direction fields, and provenance.

## Modeling decisions that matter for ingestion

- Relation names must match the source-native assertion and endpoint type.
- Gene-level sources stay in gene relations (`molecule_targets_gene`, `gene_interacts_gene`, `pathway_contains_gene`); split to protein/TF/transcript relations only with source-native endpoints/assertions.
- Protein relations require direct protein/isoform evidence or direct protein measurement. Do not project RNA/gene rows into protein edges.
- `tissue_expresses_protein` is direct HPA protein expression/staining and is canonical; `cell_type_expresses_protein` is still not canonical.
- `protein_interacts_protein` is now canonical from source-native IntAct direct PPI; BioGRID physical/PTM/complex subsets remain future decomposition, not a blind merge.
- ReMap `tf_binds_enhancer` edge/evidence is staged-only/deferred and should stay CRM/regulatory-region/support-specific; all-peak or motif-only ReMap is feature/context, not a canonical edge. The full CRM support-only feature/QA sidecar is canonically promoted under `features/remap_crm_tf_enhancer_support_full/` by `t_f2a2952e`, but remains non-topological support material.
- miRNA, lncRNA, RBP, Complex Portal, and PTM work need explicit endpoint/node/event policies before canonical promotion.
- Edges are deduplicated graph assertions; evidence rows carry source predicates, scores, assays, papers, studies, context, and provenance.
- `dataset` and `paper` nodes are disconnected provenance/catalog metadata, not training/inference graph nodes. Keep dataset/paper details in evidence/catalog metadata (`source_dataset`, `dataset_id`, `paper_id`, DOI/PMID/source-record fields, LaminDB artifacts); do not use dataset/paper relations as message-passing adjacency by default.
- Do not create placeholder Parquets just to satisfy schema coverage.

## Storage layer

- LaminDB: node registry, ontology resolution, artifact versioning
- Parquet/GCS/FUSE: canonical node, edge, feature, and evidence tables
- bionty/pertdb: ontology and perturbation/molecule management where applicable

## Graph export

Preferred target for new work is PyTorch Geometric `HeteroData`; DGL export remains fallback/backward-compatibility for older TxGNN training code. PyG/HeteroData training exports exclude `dataset` and `paper` node types, plus any relations touching them, by default even if canonical metadata files remain present. Audit/debug-only exports may opt in explicitly, but model training/inference should treat dataset/paper as metadata/evidence rather than graph adjacency.
