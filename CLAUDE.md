# TxGNN — Claude Project Context

## What This Is

TxGNN is a Python ML research library for **zero-shot drug repurposing** via
graph neural networks. It trains on a biomedical knowledge graph (17,080
diseases × 7,957 drug candidates) to predict drug indications and
contraindications.

## Expanded KG Vision

### Goal

Build a **large-scale heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph** combining
TxGNN's existing KG with OpenTargets and other sources. Nodes are registered in
**LaminDB** and identified exclusively via **ontology IDs**. Edges and node
feature tables are stored as **Parquet files**. A loader function converts
everything into a GNN-ready graph object.

### Current Export Reality (2026-06-08)

Canonical export under `gs://jouvencekb/kg/v2/` is **not yet the full expanded
KG vision**. It is currently:

- TxData legacy KG migrated to the Phase 7 Parquet layout.
- I1/I2 LaminDB/bionty registry setup and TxData node mapping.
- OpenTargets Europe PMC literature files physically added (`paper` nodes and
  `paper_mentions_gene` / `paper_mentions_disease` edges).

Important caveat: the literature slice is currently **file-present but not
graph-valid**. `paper_mentions_gene` points to Ensembl IDs (`ENSG...`) while the
current exported `nodes/gene.parquet` contains legacy TxData gene IDs
(`NCBI:*`). `paper_mentions_disease` points to OpenTargets disease IDs such as
`EFO_...` while the exported disease nodes use the legacy normalized IDs. These
two literature relations therefore have dangling endpoints until OpenTargets
target/disease nodes are truly merged into the canonical export.

`gene` does **not** mean that `transcript` and `protein` are fully represented.
The legacy TxData source conflates `gene/protein` in places, and some relations
use `protein` as an endpoint type, but there is no dedicated
`nodes/protein.parquet` or `nodes/transcript.parquet` in the current export.

#### Current Node Files on GCS

| Node type | Rows | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `disease` | 17,080 | present; legacy TxData-normalized IDs |
| `gene` | 27,610 | present; legacy `NCBI:*` IDs, not Ensembl target catalog |
| `molecule` | 8,775 | present; legacy molecule/drug IDs |
| `paper` | 2,958,199 | present; Europe PMC PMIDs |
| `pathway` | 46,503 | present; legacy GO/Reactome-derived IDs |
| `phenotype` | 15,311 | present; HP-derived |
| `tissue` | 14,033 | present; UBERON-derived |

Missing node files from the schema vision:
`transcript`, `protein`, `cell_type`, `mutation`, `organism`, `cell_line`,
`dataset`, `enhancer`.

#### Current Edge Files on GCS

| Relation | Rows | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `disease_associated_protein` | 80,411 | present |

| `pathway_child_of_pathway` | 147,680 | present |
| `pathway_contains_gene` | 297,737 | present |
| `pathway_contains_protein` | 42,646 | present |

| `tissue_expresses_protein` | 1,538,088 | present |
| `tissue_subtype_of_tissue` | 28,064 | present |

Missing edge files from the schema vision include all transcript/mutation/
enhancer/cell-type/cell-line/organism/dataset relations, plus several
OpenTargets relations that are implemented in code but not present in the
current canonical export: `disease_associated_gene`,
`disease_involves_pathway`, `tissue_expresses_gene`,
`cell_type_expresses_gene`, `cell_type_expresses_protein`,
`phenotype_associated_gene`, and the extra literature relations
`paper_mentions_protein`, `paper_mentions_molecule`,
`paper_mentions_mutation`, `paper_mentions_pathway`, `paper_cites_paper`,
`paper_produced_dataset`.

### Storage Layer

- **LaminDB**: node registry, ontology resolution, artifact versioning
- **Parquet**: one file (or directory) per edge type; node feature tables
- **bionty**: ontology resolution for Gene, Disease, Pathway, CellType, etc.
- **pertdb**: management of perturbations, and molecules

### Graph Export

Target: **PyTorch Geometric `HeteroData`** (preferred over DGL for new work —
more actively maintained, better heterogeneous graph API, richer ecosystem). DGL
`DGLHeteroGraph` kept as fallback for backward compatibility with existing TxGNN
training code.

```python
# Desired API
from txgnn import KGLoader
kg = KGLoader(data_dir='./data')
hetero_data = kg.to_pyg()   # PyG HeteroData
hetero_dgl  = kg.to_dgl()   # DGL HeteroGraph (legacy)
```

## Build Plan

### Phase 1 — Schema & ontology design ✅ (complete)

- [x] Node types + ontology namespaces defined
- [x] Full relation taxonomy with kind + direct flags
- [x] Cross-reference / alias tables (EFO↔MONDO↔HP, Ensembl↔UniProt…)
- [x] `txgnn/kg_schema.py` — Python schema as single source of truth

### Phase 2 — LaminDB schema

- [x] Set up `bionty` registries (Gene, Disease, Pathway, CellType, Tissue,
      Phenotype, Organism)
- [x] Define custom `Record` types for Paper, Transcript, Enhancer, Dataset,
      Mutation (`lnschema_txgnn`; CellLine already covered by `bionty`)
- [x] Register ontology source versions for reproducibility
      (`reproduce/register_ontology_sources.py`)

### Phase 3 — TxGNN KG migration ✅ (complete)

- [x] Map existing `node.csv` types → new ontology-based IDs
      (`manage_db/kg_migrate.py` — 129,375 nodes × 6 types,
      NCBI/HP/MONDO/GO/UBERON/CTD/Reactome/DrugBank)
- [x] Convert `kg.csv` edges → new edge Parquet schema (existing curated KG =
      credibility 3) (`manage_db/kg_migrate.py` — 8,100,498 edges × 17 relation
      files; zero unmapped relations)
- [x] Validate every node ID resolves to a bionty/LaminDB record (schema
      validation helper in `notebooks/kg_schema_overview.ipynb` §7; all IDs
      normalised to valid ontology formats)

### Phase 4 — OpenTargets ingestion ⚠️ (implemented, not fully exported)

`manage_db/ingest_opentargets.py` contains ingestion functions for the core
OpenTargets datasets, but the current canonical `gs://jouvencekb/kg/v2` export
does **not** yet reflect a complete OpenTargets run/merge.

- [ ] `ingest_targets` → Ensembl `nodes/gene.parquet` with xrefs. Implemented,
      but not merged into the canonical export; current gene nodes are legacy
      `NCBI:*`.
- [ ] `ingest_diseases` → EFO/MONDO disease nodes + hierarchy. Implemented,
      but not merged into the canonical export; current paper disease mentions
      still dangle on `EFO_...` IDs.
- [ ] `ingest_drugs` → ChEMBL molecule nodes. Implemented, but canonical export
      still appears legacy-sized (`8,775` molecule nodes).
- [x] Legacy/TxData `protein_interacts_protein`, `molecule_targets_protein`,
      indication/contraindication-like edges are present in the export.
- [ ] Full OpenTargets `interaction`, `evidence`, `go`, `reactome`,
      `indication`, and `mechanismOfAction` runs need a fresh audited merge
      into the canonical export if we want the expanded OT-scale graph.
- [ ] PARTIAL: `ingest_literature` produced and uploaded `paper` nodes plus
      `paper_mentions_gene` / `paper_mentions_disease`, but these edges are
      currently dangling because target/disease node ID spaces were not merged.

### Phase 5 — Additional sources ⚠️ (partially implemented, mostly pending export)

Additional OpenTargets-derived functions exist, but the corresponding node/edge
files are missing from the current canonical export unless listed in the
Current Export Reality section above.

- [ ] `ingest_disease_phenotype`: implemented; current export has legacy
      `disease_has_phenotype`, but not an audited OT-scale merge.
- [ ] `ingest_expression`: implemented; current export lacks
      `tissue_expresses_gene`, `cell_type_expresses_gene`, and
      `cell_type_expresses_protein`.
- [ ] `ingest_biosample`: implemented; current export lacks `cell_type` nodes.
- [ ] `ingest_pharmacogenomics`: implemented; current export lacks `mutation`
      nodes and `mutation_affects_molecule_response`.
- [ ] `ingest_variants`: smoke-tested only; full mutation/transcript/protein
      variant graph remains pending.
- [ ] `ingest_enhancers`: smoke-tested only; enhancer nodes and enhancer
      regulatory edges remain pending.

### Phase 6 — Edge credibility pipeline ✅ complete

- `manage_db/credibility.py` now houses `score_credibility`, enforcing curated
  database overrides, evidence deduplication, and author-group independence.
- Composed A→C→B paths roll up through `merge_composed_path`, propagating the
  weakest credibility and annotated intermediary context.
- `dedup_edges` regenerates credibility from merged evidence while preserving
  deterministic ordering across grouped edges.
- End-to-end coverage lives in `tests/test_credibility.py`, executed via
  `uv run --group dev pytest tests/test_credibility.py -v` on CI and locally.

### Phase 7 — Parquet storage layout ✅ (complete)

```
data/kg/
  nodes/{gene,disease,protein,…}.parquet
  edges/{relation_name}.parquet
```

- `manage_db/kg_storage.py` centralises pyarrow/fsspec writes, append deduplication, and provenance/metadata helpers.
- `manage_db/ingest_opentargets.py` and `manage_db/kg_migrate.py` now flow through the storage layer for local paths and `gs://` URIs.
- `manage_db/export_kg.py` exports legacy `data/kg` layouts into `kg/v2/`, writing provenance and `SUMMARY.md` for reproducibility.
- `tests/test_kg_storage.py` covers atomic writes, schema validation, provenance, and an optional GCS smoke round-trip.
- Legacy TxGNN KG exported to `gs://jouvencekb/kg/v2`; paper files were later
  added. Current GCS layout has 7 node files and 19 edge files, but the paper
  mention edges are not yet endpoint-valid against the exported node ID spaces.

### Phase 8 — KGLoader + graph export ✅ (complete)

- `txgnn.KGLoader(data_dir)` scans node/edge parquets and builds stable node ID maps.
- `KGLoader.validate()` reports node counts, edge counts, and dangling-edge counts.
- `KGLoader.edge_index_frames()` exports integer edge tables keyed by canonical edge type.
- `to_pyg()` → `torch_geometric.data.HeteroData` when optional PyG deps are installed.
- `to_dgl()` → `dgl.heterograph` when optional DGL deps are installed.
- `txgnn.__init__` uses lazy heavy imports so `from txgnn import KGLoader` works without importing DGL.

### Phase 9 — Validation

- [x] Dangling edge checks (`KGLoader.validate()`)
- [x] Remote smoke validation before paper upload: legacy-only
      `KGLoader("gs://jouvencekb/kg/v2").validate()` returned 129,312 nodes,
      5,848,026 edges, 0 dangling edges.
- [ ] Re-run validation after paper upload and OpenTargets node ID merge.
      Current paper files are expected to fail dangling checks because
      `paper_mentions_gene` uses `ENSG...` IDs while exported genes are
      `NCBI:*`, and `paper_mentions_disease` uses `EFO_...`/`MONDO_...` IDs
      while exported disease nodes are legacy-normalized.
- [ ] Node ontology coverage stats
- [ ] Smoke-test: load full graph into PyG once `torch`/`torch_geometric` are installed in the target runtime.
